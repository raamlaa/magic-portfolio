### 🚀 What I Do

As **Head of Content**, I manage every part of the YouTube workflow:

- **Video ideation & scripting**: aligned with audience pain points & narrative hooks
- **Thumbnail + title optimization**: strong CTR through storytelling packaging
- **Short-form adaptation**: TikTok, Reels, and Shorts as traffic channels
- **Post-launch analysis**: watch time, retention, and conversion tracking
