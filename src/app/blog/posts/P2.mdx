## I still build product like a kid with a new box of LEGO. 🧩

And I’m convinced that’s why it works.

If your inner eight-year-old still thinks anything is possible, let’s swap crayons and build something wild. 🖍️✨

I traded my solo-creator grind for a playground where I could:

🔍 **Stay wildly curious** — every creator problem is a new puzzle piece  
🧩 **Question every rule** — “But what if the brief, assets and deadlines lived in one hub?”  
🎮 **Keep it playful** — prototypes first

We’re basically a bunch of grown-up kids making magic for creators,  
and the roadmap is just one giant sheet of blank paper waiting for doodles.
