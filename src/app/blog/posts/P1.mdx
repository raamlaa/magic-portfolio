## A Creator in a PMâ€™s Body âœ¨

What youâ€™re reading right now?  
This is **version 47**.  
The ones before? RIP.

Iâ€™m **Ramla** â€” Project Manager, Gaming YouTuber, AI enthusiast, and a proud Google Calendar addict.

Iâ€™m not juggling all this because Iâ€™m lost.  
Iâ€™m doing it because I know what I love.

**Titles never really did me justice.**

Am I a PM? A creator? A builder?

Yes. But also more.

Iâ€™m here to share the real journey â€” the one with **big dreams**, **tiny wins**, **creative chaos**, and a ton of figuring things out as I go.

This is my **first post**.

If youâ€™re into content, tech, building cool stuff, or just vibing with the chaos â€” stick around.  
Weâ€™re just getting started ðŸ’™âœ¨
