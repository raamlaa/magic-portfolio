## Hey, Iâ€™m Ramla ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **content strategist, product thinker, and founder** working at the intersection of creativity, tech, and the creator economy. I currently lead content for fast-scaling YouTube creators like **KoussayBiz**, where Iâ€™ve helped launch educational products like **Freelancer Academy** and driven double-digit sales conversions through short-form content.

I'm also building **ContentControlClub (CCC)** â€” an AI-powered platform designed to help creators manage their entire content workflow, from idea to performance insights, through smart modular agents.

When Iâ€™m not leading content ops or product roadmaps, Iâ€™m diving into books like **_The 48 Laws of Power_**, studying media trends, or brainstorming the next tool to empower digital creators.

Thanks for stopping by âœ¨
